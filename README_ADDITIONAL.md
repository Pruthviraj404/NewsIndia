# NewsIndia Demo

This folder contains a small demo news/blog template (HTML, CSS, JS) designed for quickly testing layout and AdSense placements.

Files added:
- `index.html` — main page layout.
- `styles.css` — simple responsive styles.
- `script.js` — sample data renderer, search and category filter, modal reader.

Usage:
1. Open `NewsIndia/index.html` in a browser.
2. To place AdSense, replace the content of the `.ad-placeholder` element in the sidebar with your AdSense snippet.

Notes:
- This is a demo skeleton. Replace sample data in `script.js` with your backend or CMS as needed.
- Keep AdSense policy in mind when integrating real ads.
